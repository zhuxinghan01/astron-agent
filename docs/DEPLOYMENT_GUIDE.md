CONSOLE_CASDOOR_ID=your-casdoor-client-id
CONSOLE_CASDOOR_APP=your-casdoor-app-name
CONSOLE_CASDOOR_ORG=your-casdoor-org-name
```

**Obtaining Casdoor Configuration Information:**
1. Visit the Casdoor management console: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
2. Log in with the default administrator account: `admin / 123`
3. **Create Organization**
   Go to the [http://localhost:8000/organizations](http://localhost:8000/organizations) page, click "Add", fill in the organization name, save and exit.
4. **Create Application and Bind Organization**
   Go to the [http://localhost:8000/applications](http://localhost:8000/applications) page, click "Add".

   When creating the application, fill in the following information:
   - **Name**: Custom application name, e.g., `agent`
   - **Redirect URL**: Set to the project's callback address. If the Nginx exposed port is `80`, use `http://your-local-ip/callback`; if it's another port (e.g., `888`), use `http://your-local-ip:888/callback`
   - **Organization**: Select the organization name you just created
5. After saving the application, record the following information and map it to the project configuration items:

| Casdoor Information Item | Example Value | Corresponding `.env` Configuration Item |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------------------------------|
| Casdoor Service Address (URL) | `http://localhost:8000` | `CONSOLE_CASDOOR_URL=http://localhost:8000` |

### Step 4: Start astronAgent Core Services (Required Deployment Step)

#### 4.1 Configure iFLYTEK Open Platform APP_ID, API_KEY, and Related Information

For documentation, see: https://www.xfyun.cn/doc/platform/quickguide.html

After creating your application, you may need to purchase or claim API authorization service quotas for the corresponding capabilities:
- Spark LLM API: https://xinghuo.xfyun.cn/sparkapi
  (For the LLM API, you'll need an additional SPARK_API_PASSWORD available on the page)
  (The text AI generation/optimization feature for instructional assistants requires enabling Spark Ultra capability at https://console.xfyun.cn/services/bm4)
- Real-time Speech Recognition API: https://console.xfyun.cn/services/rta
- Image Generation API: https://www.xfyun.cn/services/wtop

Edit the docker/astronAgent/.env file and update the relevant environment variables:
```env
PLATFORM_APP_ID=your-app-id
PLATFORM_API_KEY=your-api-key
PLATFORM_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

SPARK_API_PASSWORD=your-api-password
SPARK_RTASR_API_KEY=your-rtasr-api-key
```

#### 4.2 If You Want to Use Spark RAG Cloud Service, Configure as Follows (Optional)

Spark RAG cloud service provides two usage methods:

##### Method 1: Obtain from the Web Interface

1. Use the APP_ID and API_SECRET created on the iFLYTEK Open Platform
2. Directly obtain the Spark dataset ID from the web interface, see: [xinghuo_rag_tool.html](/docs/xinghuo_rag_tool.html)

##### Method 2: Using cURL Command Line

If you prefer using command-line tools, you can create a dataset with the following cURL command:

```bash
# Create Spark RAG dataset
curl -X PUT 'https://chatdoc.xfyun.cn/openapi/v1/dataset/create' \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "appId: your_app_id" \
    -H "timestamp: $(date +%s)" \
    -H "signature: $(echo -n "$(echo -n "your_app_id$(date +%s)" | md5sum | awk '{print $1}')" | openssl dgst -sha1 -hmac 'your_api_secret' -binary | base64)" \
    -F "name=我的数据集"
```

**Notes:**
- Please replace `your_app_id` with your actual APP ID
- Please replace `your_api_secret` with your actual API Secret

After obtaining the dataset ID, please update it in the docker/astronAgent/.env file:
```env
XINGHUO_DATASET_ID=
```

#### 4.3 Start astronAgent Services
